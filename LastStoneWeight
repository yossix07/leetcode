# You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone.
# We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose the heaviest two stones and smash them together.
# Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights x and y with x <= y. The result of this smash is:
# If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and
# If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.
# At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.
Return the smallest possible weight of the left stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.
